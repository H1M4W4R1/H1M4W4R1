### Hi there 
I am Patrick - passionate of software development (and DiY). My main expertise is C# and Unity3D. I also work with STM32, Atmel (Microchip) and Raspberry MCUs. I tend to create, even if the project is not useful itself (see Encryption Module in my repos).

### What are main languages you code in?
* C# (3.0+)
* C/C++ (depends on platform)

### What frameworks do you work with?
* Unity3D
* Arduino / PlatformIO
* STM32 HAL

### CodersRank profile? (actually rarely updated, cuz most repos are hosted on Unity Plastic)
